Business Context: FedEx Logistics manages a complex global supply chain, dealing with shipments across various regions, countries, and industries. This dataset provides an in-depth look at their logistics processes, capturing important information on purchase orders (POs), shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and product-specific details such as item descriptions and dosage forms. Effective management of these processes ensures timely delivery, minimizes freight costs, and improves customer satisfaction.
Given the rise of eCommerce and global distribution, companies like FedEx must continuously optimize their logistics operations to maintain a competitive edge. The dataset is designed to provide insights into how shipments are managed, identify bottlenecks or delays, and ensure cost-effectiveness. By analyzing the data, FedEx Logistics aims to streamline supply chain operations, improving delivery timelines and reducing costs for both the company and its customers.

Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze logistics performance data for FedEx to evaluate shipment delays, identify on-time delivery rates, and uncover patterns in delivery performance across shipment methods and INCO terms. This analysis provides actionable insights to improve delivery efficiency and reduce delays.

Project Description:
This project uses Python to analyze and visualize logistics data, focusing on:

Understanding on-time delivery performance by shipment mode (Air, Ocean, etc.).
Evaluating vendor compliance with INCO terms like DDP, DDU, and CIP.
Identifying country-wise shipment delays and their impact on delivery timelines.
Examining relationships between shipment weight, cost, and delays.
